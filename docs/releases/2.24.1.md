## Release Notes

This release is a standard Lagoon release. There are changes that teams managing their own Lagoon installations (core and remote) may need to be aware of.

## Upgrades

### Lagoon Remote and Core updates
The process to update for this release is to update `lagoon-remote` in all remote clusters before updating `lagoon-core`.

This release requires that both `lagoon-remote` and `lagoon-core` are updated in the same window. There are features introduced in core that `lagoon-remote` requires, failure to update will result in route data not being sent back to core when a build completes. This will appear as `route` and `routes` in the API for an environment being blank. This can be avoided by updating `lagoon-remote` first.

## Deprecations

There are no required actions or considerations with this release. As always, we suggest upgrading all minor versions.
