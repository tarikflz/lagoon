## Release Notes

This release is a standard Lagoon release. There are changes that teams managing their own Lagoon installations (core and remote) may need to be aware of.

## Upgrades

### Lagoon Remote and Core updates
This release does not require that `lagoon-core` and `lagoon-remote` be updated in the same window, but they both must be updated to the latest release before enabling TLS for the broker service. The [broker TLS pull request](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-charts/pull/753) documents other considerations.

### Lagoon Logging
The `lagoon-logging` chart has been updated to include TLS support for the broker.

## Deprecations

* Lagoon Workflows have been removed. This release will delete all workflows and remove API endpoints.
* The ability to set a project specific pattern for k8s namespaces has been deprecated.
